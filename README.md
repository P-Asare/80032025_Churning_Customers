# 80032025_Churning_Customers

This project entails creating a multi-perceptron deep learning model using the Keras functional API which predicts whether
or not the customer of a phone service will churn. My model does this by predicting the likelihood of a customer churning by stating its confidence
of the customer churning.

It makes this prediction of likelihood based on 19 customer attributes which include tenure, total charges, etc. 

To build and train this model I make use of the scikit-learn library, the keras framework, the scikeras library, and other important libraries.
The model was deployed using streamlit==1.28.1
